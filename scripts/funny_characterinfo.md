Uno Reverse:

- Other players abilities work normally when Uno reverse is drunk or poisoned

- Uno Reverse activates only if chosen by a player with "choose" ability (Your ability has to explicitly say "choose a player/townsfolk/character etc."). 

  Examples:

  - If philosopher chooses Uno reverse and Uno reverse is in play, philosopher is drunk

  - If chosen by grasshopper, Uno Reverse becomes Grasshopper's alignment

- If the choose a player ability should give information about the player chosen, the user learns information about themselves instead. If the ability lets you choose more than one player simulatenously, you learn information about you + the non-unoreverse characters

- If dead and choosen by the Professor, Professor's ability works normally and uno-reverse is resurrected

Antitoxin:


- A [State](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/States) caused by a player ability that would negatively affect gameplay is considered a negative effect

  Exceptions: 
    - Being a type, alignment or character for example being the character drunk or Lunatic is not counted as a negative effect
    - being dead is not considered a negative effect

- Shortly, Drunkness, madness and poisoning are considered negative effects

- Being muted is also considered a state and a negative effect


Minion Destroyer 1000:

- Uno Reverse is poisoned and dies only if chosen by a minion with "choose" ability (the ability has to explicitly say "choose a player/townsfolk/character etc."). 

- Minions and demons use their night abilities before Minion Destroyer 1000, meaning if chosen by minion ability, the Minion Destroyer's ability does not work correctly during that night and they are completely unable to use their ability during the next night (because they are dead after the day is over)

- If chosen by a minion ability, you ignore any effects that minion ability would otherwise give you and only gain poisoning

- This means Minion destroyer does not die immediately to psychopath (as psychopath's ability says "choose" but lives for the next night and day and then dies unless killed by other means. 

- Assassin works normally because of the "even if they otherwise couldn't effect"

Volume slider:

- Storyteller may kill the muted player for non-verbal communication if it would convey too much information. (Such as showing disapproval when someone is being executed)

- Storyteller may kill the muted player if other people can hear their private conversations.

- Writing is a big no!

- Muted player cannot use abilities that requires public speaking. For example slayer using their ability while muted will result in slayer dying and their ability not working (as it requires slayer to be alive).

- Muted player can ask others to speak privately
