Uno Reverse:

- Other players abilities work normally when Uno reverse is drunk or poisoned

- Uno Reverse activates only if chosen by a player with "choose" ability (Your ability has to explicitly say "choose a player/townsfolk/character etc."). 

  Examples:

  - If philosopher chooses Uno reverse and Uno reverse is in play, philosopher is drunk

  - If chosen by grasshopper, Uno Reverse becomes Grasshopper's alignment

- If the choose a player ability should give information about the player chosen, the user learns information about themselves instead. If the ability lets you choose more than one player simulatenously, you learn information about you + the non-unoreverse characters
